# omni-vue
The application is a web project developed using the Vue.js framework. It is designed to provide detailed and interactive information about the corporate welfare plans offered by OmniNext, allowing users to explore various available options.

The main structure of the application is divided into three main components: AppHeader, AppMain, and AppFooter. The header section (AppHeader) handles the display of the navigation menu and an introductory jumbotron. The main section (AppMain) contains subsections such as PmiSection, MobileSection, WelfareSection, PlanSection, OmniGroupSection, and QASection, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the corporate welfare plan. Finally, the footer section (AppFooter) includes a contact form and additional company information.

The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. Several reusable components are used, such as BaseButton, BaseCarousel, BaseList, BasePlanCard, BasePmiCard, BaseQA, and BaseSimpleCard, to ensure a modular and maintainable structure.

The central part of the application presents detailed information about welfare plans, including benefits, features, and differences between Go and Pro plans. Interactive carousels (BaseCarousel) and frequently asked questions sections (BaseQA) are also included to enhance the user experience.

The visual aspect of the application is polished, with the use of appealing colors, illustrative images, and an intuitive design to make navigation simple and enjoyable for users. The code structure is organized and commented to facilitate understanding and maintenance by developers.
